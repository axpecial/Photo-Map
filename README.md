- Connects with Foursquare API
- Implements `LocationsViewController`
- Placeholders for `PhotoMapViewController` and `FullImageViewController`

# Lab 6 - *Photo Map*

**Photo Map** is an app that allows the user to search for locations using the [Foursquare API](https://developer.foursquare.com/docs) and create a pin with an image annotation.

Time spent: **2** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** user stories are complete:

- [ ] User can view a map (+2pt)
- [ ] User can take a photo (+1pt)
- [ ] User can tag a location (+1pt)
- [ ] User can drop a pin with image annotation (+1pt)

The following **stretch** user stories are implemented:

- [ ] User sees a custom annotation (+1pt)
- [ ] User can see Fullscreen Picture (+1pt)
- [ ] User sees a custom image for the "pin" (+1pt)
- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality! (+1-3pts)

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):
